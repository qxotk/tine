# tine: tine is not excel
Tine is a minimal desktop spreadsheet applicaiton for when one wishes to quickly visualize a simple set of rows and columns that can handle simple arithmetic - where Excel(tm) would be overkill, too costly and too slow to start up.
The performance is on the order of starting and using one's native calculator app.
